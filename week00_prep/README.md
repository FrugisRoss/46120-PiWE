# Week 0: Pre-course preparation

We begin Week 1 with peer-to-peer presentations of `week00_prep_answers.py` (see end of page). So
be sure to have it ready in class.

If you are new to programming or Python, your preparation will involve **~7 extra hours of training** in basic Python and VS Code. 
I.e., the prep time for Week 1 is significantly higher for people who are newer to Python.
Please plan your time accordingly. This skewed preparation time for newer programmers will reduce after the first few weeks.  

### You are ready for Week 1 of PiWE when you have:  
1. Installed Slack and joined the class Slack chat.
1. Installed Python and VS code.  
1. Installed scientific Python packages.  
1. Installed git.  
1. Created a GitHub account.  
1. Forked and cloned this repository.  
1. Completed the basic Python course/exercises.
1. Completed the Python exercises and `week00_prep_answers.py`.  

## Working in pairs

Everything but the last step need to be completed on your individual laptop/computer. For the final exercise,
you are welcome--nay, encouraged!--to work in pairs. Engineering is collaborative problem solving. When
you have finished `week00_prep_answers.py`, add a comment to the top with your names and make sure you
both have a copy locally before coming to class in Week 1.

## 1. Install Slack and join the class Slack chat

We use the Slack messaging platform for communication and answering questions.
You can install Slack on your laptop and on your phone.

Join the class Slackchat by navigating to the course Learn page and clicking the link in the upper right corner.

## 2. Install/verify VS Code and Python

* If you already have a Python IDE/distribution (e.g., Anaconda/Spyder, PyCharm, etc.):  
   * If you are very comfortable with your IDE and Python distribution (e.g., know how to install/uninstall
     Python packages from the terminal and run the debugger):
      * You may keep your current setup at your own risk. If Python compatibility issues arise during the
        semester, you may need to revert to the recommended set-up.  
   * If you do not know how to install packages from the terminal and/or run the debugger:  
      * Please unintall Python/Anaconda/PyCharm and any other related applications, then follow
        installation instructions in the next bullet.  
* If you need a Python IDE/distribution:  
   * Follow the instructions for "automated installation" [here at DTU Python support](https://pythonsupport.dtu.dk/install/python.html).  
   * Verify the installation per the instructions at the link.  
   * If there are issues, read the installation page thoroughly, but then contact DTU Python support
     if it still won't behave.  


## 3. Install scientific Python packages

If you already have the packages below installed in a Python distribution/environment, you may skip this step.

Search for and open Anaconda Prompt (application). In the resulting terminal, enter the following
command:  

   ```python -m pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas pytest pytest-cov pylint```  

This will install these packages to your base Python environment.
We will learn more about what they do during the course.

*If you know about environments and want to create one for this course, you are welcome to do so.
If you don't know what this means, ignore it. :)*


## 4. Install git

If you already have a git program, skip this step.

Install the git program from [this website](https://git-scm.com/).


## 5. Make a GitHub account

Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and create an account. Noice.

## 6. Clone this repository

A "repository" is often called "repo", 'cause life is short.  


1. Open this repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/DTUWind-46120-2026/46120-PiWE](https://github.com/DTUWind-46120-2026/46120-PiWE).  
1. In the upper-right corner, click the green "Code" button in the upper-right corner, and copy the HTTPS link.  
1. Create a folder on your computer where you want your PiWE materials to be saved.  
1. Open a git bash terminal in this folder. On Windows:  
   a. Right-click in the folder.  
   b. Select "More options".  
   c. Select "Open Git Bash here".  
1. In the git terminal, enter the following command:  
   ```git clone <HTTPS link you copied>```
1. This should create a subfolder called `46120-PiWE`, which should contain the repo material.  

## 7. Complete the basic Python refresher/prep course

Use ChatGPT as little as possible for these exercises.
This is basic knowledge that you should be able to remember without assistance.

**If you need help, post your questions in the course Slack chat.**

### If you are very familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks in VS Code:

Complete the module-end exercises in the `welcome_to_python.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in VS Code.

### If you have some programming knowledge but are new to Python:

See the instructions on the "Basic Python Prep Course" on Learn.
You can complete the exercises in the prep course without watching all the videos.

Afterwards, if you want more of a refresher, optionally complete the `welcome_to_python.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in VS Code.

### If you are relatively new to programming in general:

See the instructions on the "Basic Python Prep Course" on Learn.

Afterwards, if you want more practice, optionally complete the `welcome_to_python.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in VS Code.


## 8. Finish week00_prep_answers.py

Create a file called `week00_prep_answers.py` in your `46120-PiWE/week00_prep/` folder on your computer.
In this file, write code that completes Required Exercises 1 through 5 on [this page](https://python-at-risoe.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/codecamp/preparation.html#Required-exercises). 

Want to practice EVEN MORE? 😍
 * Complete the "Optional Python exercises" on the same page as Exercises 1 through 5. 
 * Go through the tutorials in `tutorials_scientific_python`

Once you're finished `week00_prep_answers.py`, you're freeeeeeeeee!
